# üåê Why Protocols Exist & What They Achieve

## ‚ùì Why Not Just Send Data Directly?

> ‚ùå The Internet is unreliable and diverse ‚Äî without protocols, communication would be chaotic.  
> ‚úÖ Protocols standardize how devices talk, ensuring **reliable, secure, structured communication**.

## ‚úÖ What Problems Do Protocols Solve?

| Problem | Protocol Solution |
|--------|--------------------|
| Different systems | Common rules (e.g. HTTP, DNS) |
| Data loss/delay | Reliable delivery (TCP) |
| Security | Encryption/auth (TLS, SSH) |
| Complex use cases | Specialized protocols (SMTP, FTP, etc.) |
| Real-time needs | Efficient transport (UDP, WebSocket) |

üìå **Protocols = agreed-upon rules**, like human languages.

## üß∞ Why So Many Protocols?

Each serves a **specific function**:

| Task | Protocol |
|------|----------|
| Web | HTTP/HTTPS |
| File transfer | FTP/SFTP |
| Remote access | SSH |
| Email | SMTP, IMAP, POP3 |
| DNS lookup | DNS |
| Real-time apps | WebSocket, WebRTC |
| Addressing | IP |
| Reliability | TCP/UDP |

## üèõÔ∏è Who Defines Protocols?

- **IETF** ‚Äì TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS
- **W3C** ‚Äì HTML, HTTP parts
- **IEEE** ‚Äì Ethernet, Wi-Fi
- **Vendors** ‚Äì Google (gRPC), Facebook (GraphQL)

üìú Published as **RFCs** (Request for Comments)

| Protocol | Year | RFC |
|----------|------|-----|
| IP | 1981 | RFC 791 |
| TCP | 1981 | RFC 793 |
| SMTP | 1982 | RFC 821 |
| DNS | 1983 | RFC 882/883 |
| HTTP/1.0 | 1996 | RFC 1945 |
| TLS 1.0 | 1999 | RFC 2246 |
| SSH | 1995 | RFC 4251 |

## üß± OSI Model ‚Äì Where Protocols Operate

| Layer | Protocols | Role |
|-------|-----------|------|
| Application | HTTP, FTP, DNS | User services |
| Presentation | TLS/SSL | Encryption/formatting |
| Session | RPC, NetBIOS | Manage sessions |
| Transport | TCP, UDP | Delivery (reliable/fast) |
| Network | IP, ICMP | Routing |
| Data Link | Ethernet, ARP | Local transmission |
| Physical | Cables, Wi-Fi | Signal transmission |

---

## üí° TL;DR

- Protocols are essential for **standard, secure, and interoperable** communication.
- Created by **standards bodies & vendors**, published as **RFCs**.
- Layered in OSI model to handle complexity in parts.
